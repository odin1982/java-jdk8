## Data Structure
	- Organize and stores data
	- each has strengths and weaknesses

## arrays
	- they're great for random access when you know the index of the item you wanna access
	- they're not so great when you don't know the index, because you have to search de
		dataset to find what you're looking for
	- order the data sequentally and they place each value in its own slot
## algoritmo
	- es una forma de realizar alguna tarea, pueden existir n diferentes formas para realizarla

## big O notation
